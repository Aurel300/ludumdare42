Theme: Running out of Space

Name: Runnink ouf of Space

Genre: Adventure / puzzle

### Plot ###

Space (the black stuff in the sky) is limited, we need to get more ink to make more Space. Unfortunately, the only way to gather enough ink is to milk a Giant Deep-Space Cuttlefiship. GDSC's envelop themselves in a protective puzzling labyrinth - a human would go mad in such a labyrinth. Instead, we are sending you, a PLYR robot with a unique ability â€“ to forget very easily. Your memory is very limited. Not because we built you cheaply or anything.

### Core mechanics ###

 - Metroidvania exploration, basic platformer movement.
 - Limited memory / inventory. Slots represent the known map, as well as known topics, known abilities.
 - Word puzzles. Characters / places where the player can modify words or demand words to open a gate. (System's Twilight swamps)
